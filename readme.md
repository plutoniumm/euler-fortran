## Project Euler in Fortran

Currently [001](./001-100/001.f90) to [003](./001-100/003.f90) are solved.

I won't put in the answers here for obvious reasons. I will however put the code, it should run as is.
Just do `gfortran ./<x01-(x+1)00>/<number>.f90 && ./a.out` and run the executable.

Projects are numbered in order of [Website Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

I chose fortran because it was designed to do Math. I wanted to learn fortran and solve Project Euler someday. Felt like a good opportunity to do both.

The following resources were used to learn fortran:
