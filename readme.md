## Project Euler in Fortran

![Score](https://projecteuler.net/profile/plutoniumm.png)

Currently [001](./001-100/001.f90) to [005](./001-100/005.f90) solved, numbered in order of [Website Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

I won't put in the answers here for obvious reasons. I will however put the code, it should run as is. The below should run it

```bash
# problem-sets are grouped in 100s: 001-100, 101-200, etc.
# Each problem 'number' is of format: XXX
$ gfortran ./<problem-set>/<number>.f90 && ./a.out
```
